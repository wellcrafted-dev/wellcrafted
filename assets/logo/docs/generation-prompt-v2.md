# Wellcrafted Logo Generation Prompt V2
## Based on Tessellated Geometry & Craft Tool Themes

Generate 20 SVG logo variations exploring the intersection of:
1. **Tessellated/Modular Geometry** (like variation 5)
2. **Digital Craft Tools** (like variation 6)

## Core Design Principles:
- Represent the `Result` pattern concept (success/error handling)
- Convey precision, modularity, and careful craftsmanship
- Use tessellation to suggest interconnected components
- Incorporate tool metaphors that blend physical craft with digital code

## Technical Requirements:
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 100 100"
- Work at 16px to 500px sizes
- Include both filled and stroke-based elements
- Use gradients strategically for depth

## Color Palettes:
### Primary Palette (Teal/Cyan):
- Deep: #0A4F7C
- Mid: #14B8A6
- Light: #5EEAD4

### Accent Palette (Orange/Coral):
- Deep: #EA580C
- Mid: #FB923C
- Light: #FDBA74

### Neutral Palette:
- Dark: #1E293B
- Mid: #374151
- Light: #9CA3AF

## 20 Variation Themes:

### Group 1: Tessellated Patterns (1-5)
1. Interlocking hexagons forming a wrench shape
2. Diamond grid with embedded code brackets
3. Triangular tessellation creating a hammer silhouette
4. Modular squares assembling into a level tool
5. Crystalline pattern forming a precision gauge

### Group 2: Tool + Geometry Fusion (6-10)
6. Hammer head made of nested diamonds
7. Chisel tip emerging from hexagonal pattern
8. Compass drawing tessellated circles
9. Blueprint grid transforming into a wrench
10. Anvil base supporting geometric modules

### Group 3: Success/Error Duality (11-15)
11. Split diamond: success (teal) / error (orange)
12. Tool that transforms based on result state
13. Tessellation that flows from order to controlled chaos
14. Precision crosshair with dual-state indicators
15. Modular blocks showing assembly/disassembly

### Group 4: Abstract Code Tools (16-20)
16. Terminal cursor as precision chisel
17. Function brackets forming tool handles
18. Variable assignment as modular connection
19. Error handling as safety mechanism
20. Type checking as measurement tool
