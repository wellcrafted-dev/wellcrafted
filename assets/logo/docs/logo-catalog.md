# Wellcrafted Logo Catalog

## Overview
This catalog contains 20 SVG logo variations for the `wellcrafted` Result pattern library. The designs explore themes of tessellated geometry and digital craft tools, representing precision, modularity, and the dual nature of Result types (success/error).

## Logo Variations

### Group 1: Tessellated Patterns (1-5)
Focus on geometric patterns and modular structures.

1. **Interlocking Hexagon Wrench** - Hexagonal modules forming a precision tool
2. **Diamond Grid Code Brackets** - Tessellated diamonds enclosed by code brackets
3. **Triangular Tessellation Hammer** - Triangular pattern creating a hammer silhouette
4. **Modular Squares Level** - Square modules forming a precision level tool
5. **Crystalline Gauge** - Crystal structure forming a measurement gauge

### Group 2: Tool + Geometry Fusion (6-10)
Blending traditional craft tools with geometric patterns.

6. **Hammer Nested Diamonds** - Hammer head composed of nested diamond shapes
7. **Chisel Hexagonal Pattern** - Chisel blade featuring hexagonal tessellation
8. **Compass Tessellated Circles** - Compass drawing overlapping circular patterns
9. **Blueprint Grid Wrench** - Wrench emerging from architectural grid
10. **Anvil Geometric Modules** - Anvil supporting various geometric shapes

### Group 3: Success/Error Duality (11-15)
Representing the Result pattern's dual nature.

11. **Split Diamond Result** - Diamond split between success (teal) and error (orange)
12. **Transforming Tool State** - Tool that changes based on result state
13. **Tessellation Order Chaos** - Pattern flowing from order to controlled chaos
14. **Precision Crosshair Dual** - Crosshair with quadrants showing dual states
15. **Modular Blocks Assembly** - Blocks showing assembly (success) vs disassembly (error)

### Group 4: Abstract Code Tools (16-20)
Code concepts reimagined as precision tools.

16. **Terminal Cursor Chisel** - Terminal cursor as a precision carving tool
17. **Function Brackets Handles** - Function syntax forming tool handles
18. **Variable Assignment Connection** - Assignment operator as modular connector
19. **Error Handling Safety** - Error handling visualized as safety mechanism
20. **Type Checking Measurement** - Type checking as precision measurement tool

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Size**: All logos work from 16px to 500px
2. **Background**: Most work on both light and dark backgrounds
3. **Format**: SVG source files in `/svg/variations/`
4. **Selection**: Choose based on:
   - Brand message (precision vs craft vs code)
   - Context (documentation, app icon, marketing)
   - Audience (developers vs general users)
